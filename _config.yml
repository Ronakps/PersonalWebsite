user_description: I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin where I major in Management Information Systems and minor in Finance. Now, looking toward my professional career, I have a deep passion for leveraging data to drive meaningful business insights and solutions. My academic background in MIS combined coding, data analytics, and business strategy. That coupled with my experience in using SQL and Python, has equipped me with the skills to adapt to new technologies and methodologies. I thrive on the challenge of working with innovative technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I am particularly excited about using these tools to enhance customer experiences. Additionally, my experience in collaborating with cross-functional teams to analyze and improve processes has reinforced my desire to be at the forefront of technological advancements that solve real-world problems.
